Topologically proctected twist in the wave function:
In the famous TKNN paper and subsequents the authors wisely argue that the transversal conductance has a topological interpretation as the integral of a certain curvature of a connection on the Brillouin zone which happens to coincide with the first Chern number for a $U(1)$ principal bundle on a manifold (torus). In particoular Kohmoto justifies the quatization of the TKNN invariant with the following argoument:
Let's $\psi_{\mathbf{k}} ( \mathbf{x} )$ be the wave function in the Brilloiun zone associated with $\mathbf{k}$ quasimomentum. He choses a section of the bundle such that $\psi_{\mathbf{k}} ( \mathbf{x}_0 )$ at fixed $\mathbf{x}_0$ is real. This of course doesn't work an the points where the wavefunction nullify. So he encircles them and defines the connection $A$ smoothly inside and outside the circles, with different prescriptions. He then applies Stoke's theorem to this situation getting a sum of line integral of the difference between the connection inside and outside the circles encompassing the singularities:

\[
\sigma_{xy} = \sum_{i} \int_{\partial S_i} ( \mathbf{A}_{out} - \mathbf{A}_{in} ) \cdot \mathbf{d l}  
\]

The difference of the connections is due to the discontinous choice of the phase: 

[\
\psi_{\mathbf{k}}^{out} = e^{i f(\mathbf{k})} \psi_{\mathbf{k}}^{in}
\]

$e^{i f(\mathbf{k})}$ needs to be single valued but f(\mathbf{k}) needn't! If the function $f$ is differentiable then we can write a gauge transformation for the potential $A$ which looks like:

\[
\mathbf{A}_{out} = \mathbf{A}_{in} + \nabla f
\]

then the total conductivity becomes:

\[
\sigma_{xy} = \sum_{i} \int_{\partial S_i} ( \nabla f) \cdot \mathbf{d l}  
\]

now the requirement for the phase difference to be well defined fixes each integral to be $2 \pi n$. 

I've alway forgetten constants in my derivations, so don't mind the extra $2 \pi$ that happears. Here we come to my questions:

\begin{itemize}
\item Is the smoothness hypothesis on $f$ well motivated? 
\item This arguments shows the quantization of the integral but don't show the stability under smooth variation of $\psi_{\mathbf{k}}$ which I expect indeed to be true.
\end{itemize}

Please, I don't know advanced maths and I cannot follow real mathematical general motivations one can find on topology books. I was looking for a more down to earth justification. 

Thanks in advance!

Topological solitons in general dimension:
Lets begin with a simple model of a field theory:

$
\mathcal{H} = \int ( \nabla \phi ) ^2
$

where $\phi$ is an angle valued field defined on some space. We suppose for the moment to freeze out the temporal dimention.

The usual argument that is employed to introduce the topological defects is to consider a configuration of the field:

$\phi: D^d \rightarrow U(1)$

where $D^d$ is the $d$-dimentional disc. The boundary conditions are given by a \emph{smooth} function:

$\phi_0: D^d \rightarrow U(1)$

The functions $\psi_0$ (up to smooth deformations) can be classified by the elements of the homotopy group $\pi_{d-1} \left( U(1) \right)$.

By this argument one can see that for this field theory there are no domain walls (which is associated to the fact that $U(1)$ is connected) but there can be vortex (and antivortex), non monopoles, ...

Vortex solutions are possible in 2D. I know that this theory can support vortex also in 3D in the form of an extended 1D singularity. The argument above doesn't seem to contain this case because a 1D vortex in a 3D fluid will produce boundary conditions on $S^2$ which are outside the hypothesis of smoothness. Indeed one would have two singularities at the two extremum of the 1D string.
Unless one has a vortex which closes onto itself by gluing the end and the beginning into a cicle. This way one would have a smooth boundary contition I think.

My question now is how to properly take in account the existance of those defects in dimensions different from the one they give smooth boundary contition. As an example: How can I theoretically justify the presence of 1D vortex in a 3D fluid when the precedent justification (by definition basically) only allows vortex in 2D?
